## Sela Developer Practice June 2016 -- Call for Papers

[Sela Developer Practice](http://www.seladeveloperpractice.com) is Israel's largest conference for software developers and IT professionals. Since the first SDP in 2009, the conference kept growing -- we now have two SDPs every year, with more than 3,000 attendees in attendance.

This year, we're running our Call for Papers on GitHub: you can submit your talk ideas, review existing submissions, comment and discuss with your fellow speakers and attendees, and update your submission as necessary.

### CFP Deadline

**The CFP is open until February 15, 2016.** However, you are encouraged to submit talks as soon as possible, so that we can start putting the agenda together. Your talks might be confirmed before the CFP closes. Under extraordinary circumstances, we might be able to accept submissions past the CFP deadline.

### How To Submit

Inspired by many other conferences who are running their CFP on GitHub, we decided to launch our CFP in the open. The open format helps us and prospective speakers keep track of the submissions and allows attendees to participate and comment on your submissions. Definitely feel free to take a look around before and after submitting your own talks. Additionally, GitHub issues are editable -- so you can always come back and tweak your submission if necessary.

#### Steps to Submit

For every speaker who is submitting talks:

1. [Create a new issue](https://github.com/selagroup/sdp-june2016-cfp/issues/new) in this repository titled `FirstName LastName Speaker Profile` (e.g. `Sasha Goldshtein Speaker Profile`).
1. Provide the speaker's name and biography.
1. Provide a link to the speaker's profile photo (200x200 JPG or PNG).
1. Provide links to relevant professional social networks such as GitHub, StackOverflow, Twitter, and LinkedIn.
1. If you need to travel internationally, please specify your origin airport. *If you are uncomfortable sharing this information publicly, please email us directly.*

For each talk or workshop that you would like to propose:

1. [Create a new issue](https://github.com/selagroup/sdp-june2016-cfp/issues/new) in this repository titled `Talk Title` (e.g. `Developing high-performance C++ algorithms`).
1. Specify the talk type (workshop, half-day workshop, or breakout session).
